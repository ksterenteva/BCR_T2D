# Analysis of BCR repertoire in patients with type 2 diabetes

### scRepertoire

To identify differences in clonal diversity of the B-cell receptor (BCR) repertoire between patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) and controls, a quantitative analysis was performed using the clonalDiversity function of the scRepertoire package. Clonotypes were defined based on strict CDR3-sequence matching, and diversity was assessed using several metrics: the Shannon index, inverse Simpson index, Gini-Simpson index, normalised entropy, and richness scores including Chao1 and ACE. For most metrics, no significant differences were found between groups. However, the Chao1 score, which reflects the estimated number of unique clones taking into account rare clones, was markedly higher in T2D patients compared to controls (362,753 vs 118,857, respectively), which may indicate an increase in rare clonal populations in diabetic patients. Analysis of BCR repertoire in patients with type 2 diabetes

BCRs are formed by somatic recombination of the gene segments **Variable (V)**, **Diversity (D)** and **Joining (J)**, which provides a wide variety of antigen-recognition domains. The most variable region of the receptor is **CDR3**, formed at the V-D-J junction region, and it is this region that determines the specificity of antigen interaction. Therefore, to better understand the B-cell receptor (BCR) repertoire in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D), we quantitatively analysed the frequency of observation of the V-, D- and J-segments of immunoglobulin heavy chain (IGH).
To assess the statistical significance of differences, Fisher's criterion followed by correction for multiple testing (FDR) was applied. The results of the analysis did not reveal any segment whose frequency of use differed significantly between groups (q-value < 0.05). In addition, visualisation of the distribution of V-, J- and VJ-segments also showed a high degree of similarity of profiles between the groups: differences in frequencies were minimal. Thus, based on the results of this study, we can conclude that the repertoire of immunoglobulin segments in B-cells of T2D patients and healthy subjects is similar.
